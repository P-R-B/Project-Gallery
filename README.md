# Project-Gallery
Collection of all my projects for my Founders and Coders application

Page available at: https://p-r-b.github.io/Project-Gallery/

Each section covers each project I have worked on. They are arranged on the page using the flexible box design CSS feature, and are responsive to the screen size, arranged in a 2x2 configuration on larger displays and in a single column on smaller displays.

This project reuses the format of my previous project (hypermiling hobby page), enabling for a consistent visual aesthetic amongst my projects and helping to simplify the coding.

The Readme will be updated as more projects will be worked on and subsequently added to the gallery.
